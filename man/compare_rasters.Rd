\title{Compare two SpatRaster objects}
\usage{
compare_rasters(raster1, raster2)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster1}{The first raster object to compare.}

\item{raster2}{The second raster object to compare.}
}
\value{
Returns TRUE if both rasters have the same number of rows, same number
        of columns, identical cell sizes, and the same CRS. Otherwise, returns FALSE.
}
\description{
Compares two SpatRaster objects to determine if they have the same dimensions,
cell size, and coordinate reference system (CRS). This function performs a
series of checks to assess whether the two rasters are equivalent in terms
of their spatial properties, which is essential for many spatial analysis
tasks that require alignment of raster layers.
