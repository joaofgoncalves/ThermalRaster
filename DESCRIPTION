Description: The package is designed to enhance the processing and
    analysis of FLIR thermal and RGB images. It offers a comprehensive
    suite of functions for extracting, processing, and visualizing thermal
    data embedded within the metadata of FLIR images. Key features also
    include retrieving full and cropped RGB images. Imagery is returned as
    SpatRaster objects compatible with the terra package, enabling to
    profit from this package features/toolkit. Using RGB images, it is
    possible to generate synthetic/predicted thermal images for the
    cropped or full RGB images via Deep Learning or Random Forests
    algorithms. The package also enables the handling of JSON
    annotations/masks from Roboflow (https://roboflow.com), enabling the
    extraction of ROIs from the images for further analysis, making
    possible assess, analyze and model fine-scale thermal variation in
    micro-habitats (i.e., TReMs - Tree Related Micro-habitats). Roboflow's
    advantages include improved ROI digitization using manual or the SAM
    (Facebook's Segment Anything) algorithm. ROI's can also be generated
    with the terra package as SpatVector objects. EXIFtool
    (https://exiftool.org/) is broadly used for retrieving metadata from
    FLIR imagery and the ThermImage package to convert from raw to 
    temperature.
